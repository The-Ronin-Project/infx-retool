        present_most_severe_first; Indicates how the question answers should be
        displayed in the mobile app by using clinical severity. Most questions
        will have this selected (ex: yes/no questions should always display yes
        first so as not to confuse the patient) but some should present in
        increasing severity where it wouldnâ€™t make sense to list the most severe
        outcome first (ex: severity questions list mild first vs very severe
        first).
